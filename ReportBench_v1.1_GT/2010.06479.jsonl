However, it is well-known that under sampling one class modifies the priors of the training set and consequently biases the posterior probabilities of a classifier. In this paper, we study analytically and experimentally how under sampling affects the posterior probability of a machine learning model. We formalize the problem of under sampling and explore the relationship between conditional probability in the presence and absence of under sampling. Although the bias due to under sampling does not affect the ranking order returned by the posterior probability, it significantly impacts the classification accuracy and probability calibration. We use Bayes Minimum Risk theory to find the correct classification threshold and show how to adjust it after under sampling. Experiments on several real-world unbalanced datasets validate our results."}}

This general area of mixed-type data is among the frontier areas, where computational intelligence approaches are often brittle compared with the capabilities of living creatures. In this paper, unsupervised feature learning (UFL) is applied to the mixed-type data to achieve a sparse representation, which makes it easier for clustering algorithms to separate the data. Unlike other UFL methods that work with homogeneous data, such as image and video data, the presented UFL works with the mixed-type data using fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART). UFL with fuzzy ART (UFLA) obtains a better clustering result by removing the differences in treating categorical and numeric features. The advantages of doing this are demonstrated with several real-world data sets with ground truth, including heart disease, teaching assistant evaluation, and credit approval. The approach is also demonstrated on noisy, mixed-type petroleum industry data. UFLA is compared with several alternative methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time UFL has been extended to accomplish the fusion of mixed data types."}}

Fraud detection has been an interesting topic in machine learning. Nevertheless, current state of the art credit card fraud detection algorithms miss to include the real costs of credit card fraud as a measure to evaluate algorithms. In this paper a new comparison measure that realistically represents the monetary gains and losses due to fraud detection is proposed. Moreover, using the proposed cost measure a cost sensitive method based on Bayes minimum risk is presented. This method is compared with state of the art algorithms and shows improvements up to 23% measured by cost. The results of this paper are based on real life transactional data provided by a large European card processing company."}}

Though fraud prevention mechanisms such as CHIP&PIN are developed for credit card systems, these mechanisms do not prevent the most common fraud types such as fraudulent credit card usages over virtual POS (Point Of Sale) terminals or mail orders so called online credit card fraud. As a result, fraud detection becomes the essential tool and probably the best way to stop such fraud types. In this study, a new cost-sensitive decision tree approach which minimizes the sum of misclassification costs while selecting the splitting attribute at each non-terminal node is developed and the performance of this approach is compared with the well-known traditional classification models on a real world credit card data set. In this approach, misclassification costs are taken as varying. The results show that this cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm outperforms the existing well-known methods on the given problem set with respect to the well-known performance metrics such as accuracy and true positive rate, but also a newly defined cost-sensitive metric specific to credit card fraud detection domain. Accordingly, financial losses due to fraudulent transactions can be decreased more by the implementation of this approach in fraud detection systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."}}

It has the appealing property of being objec- tive, requiring no subjective input from the user. On the other hand, the AUC has disadvantages, some of which are well known. For example, the AUC can give potentially misleading results if ROC curves cross. However, the AUC also has a much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to have been previously recognised. This is that it is fundamentally incoherent in terms of misclassification costs: the AUC uses different misclassification cost distributions for different classifiers. This means that using the AUC is equivalent to using different metrics to evaluate different classification rules. It is equivalent to saying that, using one classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is p times as serious as misclassifying a class 0 point, but, using another classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is P times as serious, where p ?= P. This is nonsensical because the relative severities of different kinds of misclassifications of individual points is a property of the problem, not the classifiers which happen to have been chosen. This property is explored in detail, and a simple valid alternative to the AUC is proposed."}}

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision\/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets."}}
