While this increased sensitivity improves the likelihood of discoveries, it also makes these instruments more susceptible to the deleterious effects of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The challenge posed by RFI is exacerbated by the high data-rates achieved by modern radio telescopes, which require real-time processing to keep up with the data. Furthermore, the high data-rates do not allow for permanent storage of observations at high resolution. Offline RFI mitigation is therefore not possible anymore. The realtime requirement makes RFI mitigation even more challenging because, on one side, the techniques used for mitigation need to be fast and simple, and on the other side they also need to be robust enough to cope with just a partial view of the data.","pages":"1-8","number":"","volume":"","year":"2019","booktitle":"2019 RFI Workshop - Coexisting with Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)"}}
