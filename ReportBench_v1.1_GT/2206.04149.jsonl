These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising the prediction performance.","doi":"10.1145\/3467981","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/3467981","issn":"2691-1914","number":"4","volume":"2","address":"New York, NY, USA","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","issue_date":"November 2021","year":"2021"}}

Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations.We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains.

Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose \"behaviors'' deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real-time. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NetWalk.","doi":"10.1145\/3219819.3220024","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/3219819.3220024","address":"New York, NY, USA","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":"9781450355520","year":"2018"}}

To overcome known limitations of GNN autoencoders, we design a symmetric decoder capable of simultaneously reconstructing edge features and node features. Focusing on latent space based discriminators, we find that such setups provide a promising avenue to isolate new physics and competing SM signatures from sensitivity-limiting QCD jet contributions. We demonstrate the flexibility and broad applicability of this approach using examples of W bosons, top quarks, and exotic hadronically-decaying exotic scalar bosons."}}

However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, $X = L_D + S$, where $L_D$ can be effectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and $S$ contains the outliers and noise in the original data X. Since such splitting increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a \"Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)\". Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such \"Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)\" give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.","doi":"10.1145\/3097983.3098052","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/3097983.3098052","address":"New York, NY, USA","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":"9781450348874","year":"2017"}}

Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.","doi":"10.1145\/1970392.1970395","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/1970392.1970395","issn":"0004-5411","number":"3","volume":"58","address":"New York, NY, USA","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","issue_date":"May 2011","year":"2011"}}

Autoencoder neural networks learn to reconstruct normal images, and hence can classify those images as anomalies, where the reconstruction error exceeds some threshold. Here we analyze a fundamental problem of this approach when the training set is contaminated with a small fraction of outliers. We find that continued training of autoencoders inevitably reduces the reconstruction error of outliers, and hence degrades the anomaly detection performance. In order to counteract this effect, an adversarial autoencoder architecture is adapted, which imposes a prior distribution on the latent representation, typically placing anomalies into low likelihood-regions. Utilizing the likelihood model, potential anomalies can be identified and rejected already during training, which results in an anomaly detector that is significantly more robust to the presence of outliers during training.","pages":"206--222","address":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","year":"2020","booktitle":"Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases","editor":"Brefeld, Ulf\nand Fromont, Elisa\nand Hotho, Andreas\nand Knobbe, Arno\nand Maathuis, Marloes\nand Robardet, Céline"}}

This vulnerability hinders efficient and timely response in various WSN applications, such as healthcare. For example, faulty measurements can create false alarms which may require unnecessary intervention from healthcare personnel. Therefore, an approach to differentiate between real medical conditions and false alarms will improve remote patient monitoring systems and quality of healthcare service afforded by WSN. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to detect sensor anomaly by analyzing collected physiological data from medical sensors. The objective of this method is to effectively distinguish false alarms from true alarms. It predicts a sensor value from historic values and compares it with the actual sensed value for a particular instance. The difference is compared against a threshold value, which is dynamically adjusted, to ascertain whether the sensor value is anomalous. The proposed approach has been applied to real healthcare datasets and compared with existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, providing high Detection Rate (DR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).","issn":"1424-8220","pubmedid":"25884786","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/4\/8764","pages":"8764--8786","number":"4","year":"2015","volume":"15","journal":"Sensors"}}

This is an important research problem, due to its broad set of application domains, from data analysis to e-health, cybersecurity, predictive maintenance, fault prevention, and industrial automation. Herein, we review state-of-the-art methods that may be employed to detect anomalies in the specific area of sensor systems, which poses hard challenges in terms of information fusion, data volumes, data speed, and network\/energy efficiency, to mention but the most pressing ones. In this context, anomaly detection is a particularly hard problem, given the need to find computing-energy-accuracy trade-offs in a constrained environment. We taxonomize methods ranging from conventional techniques (statistical methods, time-series analysis, signal processing, etc.) to data-driven techniques (supervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, etc.). We also look at the impact that different architectural environments (Cloud, Fog, Edge) can have on the sensors ecosystem. The review points to the most promising intelligent-sensing methods, and pinpoints a set of interesting open issues and challenges.","keywords":"Anomaly detection, Machine learning, Sensor systems, Internet of Things, Intelligent sensing","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S156625352 0303717","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.inffus.2020.10.001","issn":"1566-2535","year":"2021","pages":"64-79","volume":"67","journal":"Information Fusion"}}

Deep learning has gained tremendous success in transforming many data mining and machine learning tasks, but popular deep learning techniques are inapplicable to anomaly detection due to some unique characteristics of anomalies, e.g., rarity, heterogeneity, boundless nature, and prohibitively high cost of collecting large-scale anomaly data. Through this tutorial, audiences would gain a systematic overview of this area, learn the key intuitions, objective functions, underlying assumptions, advantages and disadvantages of different categories of state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection methods, and recognize its broad real-world applicability in diverse domains. We also discuss what challenges the current deep anomaly detection methods can address and envision this area from multiple different perspectives. Any audience who may be interested in deep learning, anomaly\/outlier\/novelty detection, out-of-distribution detection, representation learning with limited labeled data, and self-supervised representation learning would find it very helpful in attending this tutorial.
