The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks."}}

Deep learning approaches have been commonly employed for the SITS classification and have provided state-of-the-art performance. However, deep learning methods suffer from overfitting when labeled data are scarce. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining scheme to initialize a transformer-based network by utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In detail, the model is asked to predict randomly contaminated observations given an entire time series of a pixel. The main idea of our proposal is to leverage the inherent temporal structure of satellite time series to learn general-purpose spectraloral representations related to land cover semantics. Once pretraining is completed, the pretrained network can be further adapted to various SITS classification tasks by fine-tuning all the model parameters on small-scale task-related labeled data. In this way, the general knowledge and representations about SITS can be transferred to a label-scarce task, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model as well as reducing the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on three benchmark datasets over large study areas. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining scheme, leading to substantial improvements in classification accuracy using transformer, 1-D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional long short-term memory network. The code and the pretrained model will be available at https:\/\/github.com\/linlei1214\/SITS-BERT upon publication."}}

The nearest neighbour algorithm (NN) using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure is a leading algorithm for this task. NN compares each time series to be classified to every time series in the training database. With a training database of N time series of lengths L, each classification requires $ν$(N ˙ L2) computations. The databases used in almost all prior research have been relatively small (with less than 10; 000 samples) and much of the research has focused on making DTW's complexity linear with L, leading to a runtime complexity of O(N ˙ L). As we demonstrate with an example in remote sensing, real-world time series databases are now reaching the million-to-billion scale. This wealth of training data brings the promise of higher accuracy, but raises a significant challenge because N is becoming the limiting factor. As DTW is not a metric, indexing objects induced by its space is extremely challenging. We tackle this task in this paper. We develop TSI, a novel algorithm for Time Series Indexing which combines a hierarchy of K-means clustering with DTW-based lower-bounding. We show that, on large databases, TSI makes it possible to classify time series orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art."}}

Because tree mortality is a spatially and temporally erratic process, rates and spatial patterns of tree mortality are difficult to estimate with traditional inventory methods. Remote sensing imagery has the potential to detect tree mortality at spatial scales required for accurately characterizing this process (e.g., landscape, region). Many efforts have been made in this sense, mostly using pixel- or object-based methods. In this study, we explored the potential of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and map tree health status and functional type over entire regions. To do this, we built a database of around 290,000 photo-interpreted trees that served to extract and label image windows from 20 cm-resolution digital aerial images, for use in CNN training and evaluation. In this process, we also evaluated the effect of window size and spectral channel selection on classification accuracy, and we assessed if multiple realizations of a CNN, generated using different weight initializations, can be aggregated to provide more robust predictions. Finally, we extended our model with 5 additional classes to account for the diversity of landcovers found in our study area. When predicting tree health status only (live or dead), we obtained test accuracies of up to 94%, and up to 86% when predicting functional type only (broadleaf or needleleaf). Channel selection had a limited impact on overall classification accuracy, while window size increased the ability of the CNNs to predict plant functional type. The aggregation of multiple realizations of a CNN allowed us to avoid the selection of suboptimal models and help to remove much of the speckle effect when predicting on new aerial images. Test accuracies of plant functional type and health status were not affected in the extended model and were all above 95% for the 5 extra classes. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the CNN for between-scene variations in aerial photography and also suggest that this approach can be applied at operational level to map tree mortality across extensive territories."}}

Efficiently making use of the entire body of information is a current challenge in remote sensing; it demands lightweight problem-agnostic models that do not require region- or problem-specific expert knowledge. End-to-end trained deep learning models can make use of raw sensory data by learning feature extraction and classification in one step, solely from data. Still, many methods proposed in remote sensing research require implicit feature extraction through data preprocessing or explicit design of features. In this work, we compare recent deep learning models on crop type classification on raw and preprocessed Sentinel 2 data. We concentrate on the common neural network architectures for time series, i.e., 1D-convolutions, recurrence, and the novel self-attention architecture. Our central findings are that data preprocessing still increased the overall classification performance for all models while the choice of model was less crucial. Self-attention and recurrent neural networks, by their architecture, outperformed convolutional neural networks on raw satellite time series. We explore this by a feature importance analysis based on gradient backpropagation that exploits the differentiable nature of deep learning models. Further, we qualitatively show how self-attention scores focus selectively on a few classification-relevant observations."}}

The concept of neural network has gained much significance in the analysis of vegetation dynamics using remote sensing satellite data. In the current study an attempt has been made to predict the vegetation dynamics using MODIS NDVI time series data sets and long short term memory network, an advanced technique adapted from the artificial neural network. The dataset of 861 NDVI images from January 2000 to June 2016 is used for making the time series. The data is segregated into three sets which comprises of training set (70%), validation set (20%), and testing set (10%). To check the reliability of the experiment we have finalised two different regions after extensive research for investigation. These include different terrains in the Great Nicobar Islands, one region along the coast where vegetation has severe ecological damage due to 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the other, an interior region which remained imperturbable during the tsunami. Long short term memory network, an advanced neural network is trained with these NDVI values for both the regions separately to predict the future vegetation dynamics. To measure the accuracy of the LSTM network, root mean square error is calculated. The resulting plots from both the experiments indicate that the long short-term memory neural network follows the series in addition to coinciding with the required time series. Also, an unanticipated change in the trend of the NDVI series were well adapted by the network and was able to predict the future NDVI values with good accuracy maintaining RMSE less than 0.03 without providing any supplementary data. By adopting the prescribed method in the paper, anticipation of vegetation changes can be done accurately much ahead of time and take proactive measures accordingly to safeguard and improve the vegetation in any area."}}

An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network “ZA Armorique” (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation relevés were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70).

Although traditional classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have been successfully applied to create land cover maps from SITS, these algorithms do not make the most of the temporal domain. This paper proposes a comprehensive study of Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs), a deep learning approach which applies convolutions in the temporal dimension in order to automatically learn temporal (and spectral) features. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the contribution of TempCNNs for SITS classification, as compared to RF and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) -a standard deep learning approach that is particularly suited to temporal data.

The experimental results show that TempCNNs are more accurate than the current state of the art for SITS classification. We provide some general guidelines on the network architecture, common regularization mechanisms, and hyper-parameter values such as batch size; we also draw out some differences with standard results in computer vision (e.g., about pooling layers).

These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas. This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 % for RF and 77.1 % for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1% OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data – composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and\/or temporal features – are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost. Eventually, the classifier accuracy is assessed on a larger area where the landscape variabilities affect the classification performances."}}

Satellite remote sensing is a key technology for generating these maps. Until recently, land cover mapping has been limited to static approaches, which have primarily led to the production of either global maps at coarse spatial resolutions or geographically restricted maps at high spatial resolutions. The recent availability of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite image time series (SITS) which provide access to high spatial and very high temporal resolutions, is a game changer, offering opportunities to map land cover using both temporal and spatial information. These data moreover open interesting perspectives for land cover mapping based on data combination approach. However, the usefulness of combining dense time series (more than 30 images per year) and data combination approaches to map natural vegetation has so far not been assessed. To address this gap, this contribution tests the idea that the combined consideration of optical and radar data combination and time series analyses can significantly improve natural vegetation mapping in the Pendjari National Park, a Sahelian savanna protected area in Benin. Results highlight that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 SITS performs as well as Sentinel-2 SITS alone in terms of classification accuracy. Land cover maps are however qualitatively better when considering the data combination approach. Our results also clearly show that the use of dense\/hypertemporal optical time series significantly improves classification outcomes compared to using multitemporal only a few images per year) or monotemporal data. Altogether, this work thus demonstrates the ability of dense SITS to improve discrimination of natural vegetation types using information on their phenology, leading to more detailed and more reliable maps for environmental management."}}

Multiple constellations could be a solution if without concerning cost, and thus it is so far interesting but very challenging to develop a method which can simultaneously improve both spatial and temporal details. There are some research efforts to deal with the problem from various aspects, a type of approaches is to enhance the spatial resolution using techniques of super resolution, pan-sharpen etc. which can produce good visual effects, but mostly cannot preserve spectral signatures and result in losing analytical value. Another type is to fill temporal frequency gaps by adopting time interpolation, which actually doesn't increase informative context at all. In this paper we presented a novel method to generate satellite images in higher spatial and temporal details, which further enables satellite image time series simulation. Our method starts with a pair of high-low resolution data set, and then a spatial registration is done by introducing LDA model to map high and low resolution pixels correspondingly. Afterwards, temporal change information is captured through a comparison of low resolution time series data, and the temporal change is then projected onto high resolution data plane and assigned to each high resolution pixel referring the predefined temporal change patterns of each type of ground objects to generate a simulated high resolution data. A preliminary experiment shows that our method can simulate a high resolution data with a good accuracy. We consider the contribution of our method is to enable timely monitoring of temporal changes through analysis of low resolution images time series only, and usage of costly high resolution data can be reduced as much as possible, and it presents an efficient solution with great cost performance to build up an economically operational monitoring service for environment, agriculture, forest, land use investigation, and other applications. © 2014 SPIE."}}

Land cover changes naturally over time, as well as a result of anthropogenic activities. Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data-particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)-coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization."}}

Building on recent work employing multi-headed self-attention mechanisms to classify remote sensing time sequences, we propose a modification of the Temporal Attention Encoder of Garnot et al. [5]. In our network, the channels of the temporal inputs are distributed among several compact attention heads operating in parallel. Each head extracts highly-specialized temporal features which are in turn concatenated into a single representation. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms on an open-access satellite image dataset, while using significantly fewer parameters and with a reduced computational complexity."}}

This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network's generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets."}}

However, it still remains challenging and falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into account the fact that time series often have features at different time scales. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model, Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN), which incorporates feature extraction and classification in a single framework. Leveraging a novel multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically extracts features at different scales and frequencies, leading to superior feature representation. MCNN is also computationally efficient, as it naturally leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with various existing methods on a large number of benchmark datasets, and show that MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods."}}

One main challenge in TSC is the diversity of domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no “one model that fits all” in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific type of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target the existence\/non-existence of specific patterns\/shapelets. Yet other techniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating patterns\/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that addresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method. The technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through “compound eyes” that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each ommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a broad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses and representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for broader visibility. These lenses have been created through hyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and Fourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens, then performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most confident eyes, i.e., forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye, using the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more than 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits of bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and robustness of Co-eye in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques."}}

The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks."}}

Deep learning approaches have been commonly employed for the SITS classification and have provided state-of-the-art performance. However, deep learning methods suffer from overfitting when labeled data are scarce. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining scheme to initialize a transformer-based network by utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In detail, the model is asked to predict randomly contaminated observations given an entire time series of a pixel. The main idea of our proposal is to leverage the inherent temporal structure of satellite time series to learn general-purpose spectraloral representations related to land cover semantics. Once pretraining is completed, the pretrained network can be further adapted to various SITS classification tasks by fine-tuning all the model parameters on small-scale task-related labeled data. In this way, the general knowledge and representations about SITS can be transferred to a label-scarce task, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model as well as reducing the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on three benchmark datasets over large study areas. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining scheme, leading to substantial improvements in classification accuracy using transformer, 1-D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional long short-term memory network.

The nearest neighbour algorithm (NN) using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure is a leading algorithm for this task. NN compares each time series to be classified to every time series in the training database. With a training database of N time series of lengths L, each classification requires $ν$(N ˙ L2) computations. The databases used in almost all prior research have been relatively small (with less than 10; 000 samples) and much of the research has focused on making DTW's complexity linear with L, leading to a runtime complexity of O(N ˙ L). As we demonstrate with an example in remote sensing, real-world time series databases are now reaching the million-to-billion scale. This wealth of training data brings the promise of higher accuracy, but raises a significant challenge because N is becoming the limiting factor. As DTW is not a metric, indexing objects induced by its space is extremely challenging. We tackle this task in this paper. We develop TSI, a novel algorithm for Time Series Indexing which combines a hierarchy of K-means clustering with DTW-based lower-bounding. We show that, on large databases, TSI makes it possible to classify time series orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art."}}

Because tree mortality is a spatially and temporally erratic process, rates and spatial patterns of tree mortality are difficult to estimate with traditional inventory methods. Remote sensing imagery has the potential to detect tree mortality at spatial scales required for accurately characterizing this process (e.g., landscape, region). Many efforts have been made in this sense, mostly using pixel- or object-based methods. In this study, we explored the potential of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and map tree health status and functional type over entire regions. To do this, we built a database of around 290,000 photo-interpreted trees that served to extract and label image windows from 20 cm-resolution digital aerial images, for use in CNN training and evaluation. In this process, we also evaluated the effect of window size and spectral channel selection on classification accuracy, and we assessed if multiple realizations of a CNN, generated using different weight initializations, can be aggregated to provide more robust predictions. Finally, we extended our model with 5 additional classes to account for the diversity of landcovers found in our study area. When predicting tree health status only (live or dead), we obtained test accuracies of up to 94%, and up to 86% when predicting functional type only (broadleaf or needleleaf). Channel selection had a limited impact on overall classification accuracy, while window size increased the ability of the CNNs to predict plant functional type. The aggregation of multiple realizations of a CNN allowed us to avoid the selection of suboptimal models and help to remove much of the speckle effect when predicting on new aerial images. Test accuracies of plant functional type and health status were not affected in the extended model and were all above 95% for the 5 extra classes. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the CNN for between-scene variations in aerial photography and also suggest that this approach can be applied at operational level to map tree mortality across extensive territories."}}

Efficiently making use of the entire body of information is a current challenge in remote sensing; it demands lightweight problem-agnostic models that do not require region- or problem-specific expert knowledge. End-to-end trained deep learning models can make use of raw sensory data by learning feature extraction and classification in one step, solely from data. Still, many methods proposed in remote sensing research require implicit feature extraction through data preprocessing or explicit design of features. In this work, we compare recent deep learning models on crop type classification on raw and preprocessed Sentinel 2 data. We concentrate on the common neural network architectures for time series, i.e., 1D-convolutions, recurrence, and the novel self-attention architecture. Our central findings are that data preprocessing still increased the overall classification performance for all models while the choice of model was less crucial. Self-attention and recurrent neural networks, by their architecture, outperformed convolutional neural networks on raw satellite time series. We explore this by a feature importance analysis based on gradient backpropagation that exploits the differentiable nature of deep learning models. Further, we qualitatively show how self-attention scores focus selectively on a few classification-relevant observations."}}

The concept of neural network has gained much significance in the analysis of vegetation dynamics using remote sensing satellite data. In the current study an attempt has been made to predict the vegetation dynamics using MODIS NDVI time series data sets and long short term memory network, an advanced technique adapted from the artificial neural network. The dataset of 861 NDVI images from January 2000 to June 2016 is used for making the time series. The data is segregated into three sets which comprises of training set (70%), validation set (20%), and testing set (10%). To check the reliability of the experiment we have finalised two different regions after extensive research for investigation. These include different terrains in the Great Nicobar Islands, one region along the coast where vegetation has severe ecological damage due to 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the other, an interior region which remained imperturbable during the tsunami. Long short term memory network, an advanced neural network is trained with these NDVI values for both the regions separately to predict the future vegetation dynamics. To measure the accuracy of the LSTM network, root mean square error is calculated. The resulting plots from both the experiments indicate that the long short-term memory neural network follows the series in addition to coinciding with the required time series. Also, an unanticipated change in the trend of the NDVI series were well adapted by the network and was able to predict the future NDVI values with good accuracy maintaining RMSE less than 0.03 without providing any supplementary data. By adopting the prescribed method in the paper, anticipation of vegetation changes can be done accurately much ahead of time and take proactive measures accordingly to safeguard and improve the vegetation in any area."}}

An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network “ZA Armorique” (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation relevés were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70).

Although traditional classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have been successfully applied to create land cover maps from SITS, these algorithms do not make the most of the temporal domain.

These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas. This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 % for RF and 77.1 % for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1% OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data – composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and\/or temporal features – are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost. Eventually, the classifier accuracy is assessed on a larger area where the landscape variabilities affect the classification performances."}}

Until recently, land cover mapping has been limited to static approaches, which have primarily led to the production of either global maps at coarse spatial resolutions or geographically restricted maps at high spatial resolutions. The recent availability of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite image time series (SITS) which provide access to high spatial and very high temporal resolutions, is a game changer, offering opportunities to map land cover using both temporal and spatial information. These data moreover open interesting perspectives for land cover mapping based on data combination approach. However, the usefulness of combining dense time series (more than 30 images per year) and data combination approaches to map natural vegetation has so far not been assessed. To address this gap, this contribution tests the idea that the combined consideration of optical and radar data combination and time series analyses can significantly improve natural vegetation mapping in the Pendjari National Park, a Sahelian savanna protected area in Benin. Results highlight that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 SITS performs as well as Sentinel-2 SITS alone in terms of classification accuracy. Land cover maps are however qualitatively better when considering the data combination approach. Our results also clearly show that the use of dense\/hypertemporal optical time series significantly improves classification outcomes compared to using multitemporal only a few images per year) or monotemporal data. Altogether, this work thus demonstrates the ability of dense SITS to improve discrimination of natural vegetation types using information on their phenology, leading to more detailed and more reliable maps for environmental management."}}

There are some research efforts to deal with the problem from various aspects, a type of approaches is to enhance the spatial resolution using techniques of super resolution, pan-sharpen etc. which can produce good visual effects, but mostly cannot preserve spectral signatures and result in losing analytical value. Another type is to fill temporal frequency gaps by adopting time interpolation, which actually doesn't increase informative context at all. In this paper we presented a novel method to generate satellite images in higher spatial and temporal details, which further enables satellite image time series simulation. Our method starts with a pair of high-low resolution data set, and then a spatial registration is done by introducing LDA model to map high and low resolution pixels correspondingly. Afterwards, temporal change information is captured through a comparison of low resolution time series data, and the temporal change is then projected onto high resolution data plane and assigned to each high resolution pixel referring the predefined temporal change patterns of each type of ground objects to generate a simulated high resolution data. A preliminary experiment shows that our method can simulate a high resolution data with a good accuracy. We consider the contribution of our method is to enable timely monitoring of temporal changes through analysis of low resolution images time series only, and usage of costly high resolution data can be reduced as much as possible, and it presents an efficient solution with great cost performance to build up an economically operational monitoring service for environment, agriculture, forest, land use investigation, and other applications. © 2014 SPIE."}}

Land cover changes naturally over time, as well as a result of anthropogenic activities. Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data-particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)-coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization."}}

Building on recent work employing multi-headed self-attention mechanisms to classify remote sensing time sequences, we propose a modification of the Temporal Attention Encoder of Garnot et al. [5]. In our network, the channels of the temporal inputs are distributed among several compact attention heads operating in parallel. Each head extracts highly-specialized temporal features which are in turn concatenated into a single representation. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms on an open-access satellite image dataset, while using significantly fewer parameters and with a reduced computational complexity."}}

This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network's generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets."}}

However, it still remains challenging and falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into account the fact that time series often have features at different time scales. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model, Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN), which incorporates feature extraction and classification in a single framework. Leveraging a novel multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically extracts features at different scales and frequencies, leading to superior feature representation. MCNN is also computationally efficient, as it naturally leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with various existing methods on a large number of benchmark datasets, and show that MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods."}}

One main challenge in TSC is the diversity of domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no “one model that fits all” in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific type of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target the existence\/non-existence of specific patterns\/shapelets. Yet other techniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating patterns\/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that addresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method. The technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through “compound eyes” that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each ommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a broad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses and representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for broader visibility. These lenses have been created through hyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and Fourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens, then performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most confident eyes, i.e., forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye, using the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more than 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits of bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and robustness of Co-eye in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques."}}

Secondly, the 3D CNN framework with fine-tuned parameters is designed for training 3D crop samples and learning spatio-temporal discriminative representations, with the full crop growth cycles being preserved. In addition, we introduce an active learning strategy to the CNN model to improve labelling accuracy up to a required threshold with the most efficiency. Finally, experiments are carried out to test the advantage of the 3D CNN, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) CNN and other conventional methods.
