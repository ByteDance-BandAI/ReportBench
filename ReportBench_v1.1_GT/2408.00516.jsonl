In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting in significant penalties and unmeasurable reputation loss. Existing traditional maintenance approaches suffer from some assumptions and limits, such as high prevent\/repair costs, inadequate or inaccurate mathematical degradation processes and manual feature extraction. With the trend of smart manufacturing and development of Internet of Things (IoT), data mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc., PdM is proposed as a novel type of maintenance paradigm to perform maintenances only after the analytical models predict certain failures or degradations. In this survey, we first provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including the Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), cloud-enhanced PdM system and PdM 4.0, etc. Then, we make clear the specific maintenance purposes\/objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization, availability\/reliability maximization and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we provide a review of the existing approaches for fault diagnosis and prognosis in PdM systems that include three major subcategories: knowledge based, traditional Machine Learning (ML) based and DL based approaches. We make a brief review on the knowledge based and traditional ML based approaches applied in diverse industrial systems or components with a complete list of references, while providing a comprehensive review of DL based approaches. Finally, important future research directions are introduced."}}

At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud\/fog\/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human-machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors.

For predictive maintenance, the fault representing frequencies at the incipient stage are very difficult to detect due to their small amplitude and the leakage of powerful frequency components into other parts of the spectrum. For this purpose, offline advanced signal processing techniques are used that cannot be performed in small signal processing devices due to the required computational time, complexity, and memory.

The combination of data from many sensors allows a richer representation of the observed phenomenon, e.g., system degradation, which can facilitate analysis and decision-making processes. This work addresses the topic of predictive maintenance by exploiting sensor data fusion and artificial intelligence-based analysis. With a dataset such as vibration and sound from sensors, we focus on studying paradigms that orchestrate the most optimal combination of sensors with deep learning sensor fusion algorithms to enable predictive maintenance. In our experimental setup, we used raw data obtained from two sensors, a microphone, and an accelerometer installed on a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor. The data from each sensor were processed individually and, in a second step, merged to create a solid base for analysis. To diagnose BLDC motor faults, this work proposes to use data-level sensor fusion with deep learning methods such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for their ability to automatically extract relevant information from the input data, the long short-term memory method (LSTM), and convolutional long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), a combination of the two previous methods. The results show that in our setup, sound signals outperform vibrations when used individually for training. However, without any feature selection\/extraction step, the accuracy of the models improves with data fusion and reaches 98.8%, 93.5%, and 73.6% for the DCNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM methods, respectively, 98.8% being a performance that, according to our reading, has never been reached in the analysis of the faults of a BLDC motor without first going through the extraction of the characteristics and their fusion by traditional methods. These results show that it is possible to work with raw data from multiple sensors and achieve good results using deep learning methods without spending time and resources on selecting appropriate features to extract and methods to use for feature extraction and data fusion."}}

We present a spike-based end-to-end pipeline able to detect system anomalies from vibration data, using building blocks that are compatible with analog-digital neuromorphic circuits.

With the increasing amount of condition monitoring data, deep-learning-based methods have become promising ways for intelligent fault diagnosis thanks to their automatic feature extraction capability. Most recently, the third-generation neural network, called spiking neural network (SNN), has been introduced as an effective tool for fault diagnosis. However, the internal state and the error function of neurons in the SNN model cannot satisfy the conditions of continuity and differentiability, resulting in the difficulty of the gradient back-propagation, and it, therefore, prevents the extension of the SNN to a deep manner. In this article, a probabilistic spiking response model (PSRM) with a multi-layer structure is put forth to enhance the performance of the SNN in terms of bearing fault diagnosis. In the PSRM, the extracted features from the local mean decomposition (LMD) method are converted into the probability pulse sequences, and a multi-layer learning algorithm is developed to facilitate the multi-layer network training. The fault diagnosis results from three bearing databases, i.e., CWRU, MFPT, and Paderborn University datasets, demonstrate that the proposed PSRM exceeds a majority of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The proposed multi-layer SNN can also provide transparency to different bearing fault patterns by the membrane potentials of the spiking neurons in the output layer.","doi":"10.1016\/j.ress.2022.108561","url":"https:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0951832022002095","issn":"09518320","volume":"225"}}

The proposed solution exploits recurrent spiking neural networks (LSNNs), which are emerging for their theoretical energy efﬁciency and compactness, to recognise damage conditions by processing data from low-cost accelerometers (MEMS) directly on the sensor node. We focus on designing an efﬁcient coding of MEMS data to optimise SNN execution on a low-power microcontroller. We characterised and proﬁled LSNN performance and energy consumption on a hardware prototype sensor node equipped with an STM32 embedded microcontroller and a digital MEMS accelerometer. We used a hardware-in-the-loop environment with virtual sensors generating data on an SPI interface connected to the physical microcontroller to evaluate the system with a data stream from a real viaduct. We exploited this environment also to study the impact of different on-sensor encoding techniques, mimicking a bio-inspired sensor able to generate events instead of accelerations. Obtained results show that the proposed optimised embedded LSNN (eLSNN), when using a spike-based input encoding technique, achieves 54% lower execution time with respect to a naive LSNN algorithm implementation present in the state-of-the-art. The optimised eLSNN requires around 47 kCycles, which is comparable with the data transfer cost from the SPI interface. However, the spike-based encoding technique requires considerably larger input vectors to get the same classiﬁcation accuracy, resulting in a longer pre-processing and sensor access time. Overall the event-based encoding techniques leads to a longer execution time (1.49×) but similar energy consumption. Moving this coding on the sensor can remove this limitation leading to an overall more energy-efﬁcient monitoring system.","doi":"10.3390\/fi13080219","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-5903\/13\/8\/219","issn":"1999-5903","volume":"13"}}

A signiﬁcant difﬁculty for the practical application of SNNs is their poor suitability for von Neumann computer architecture, so many researchers are currently focusing on the development of alternative hardware. Nevertheless, today several experimental libraries implementing SNNs for conventional computers are available. In this paper, using the RCNet library, we compare the performance of reservoir computing architectures based on artiﬁcial and spiking neural networks. We explicitly show that, despite the higher execution time, SNNs can demonstrate outstanding classiﬁcation accuracy in the case of complicated datasets, such as data from industrial sensors used for the fault detection of bearings and gears. For one of the test problems, namely, ball bearing diagnosis using an accelerometer, the accuracy of the classiﬁcation using reservoir SNN almost reached 100%, while the reservoir ANN was able to achieve recognition accuracy up to only 61%. The results of the study clearly demonstrate the superiority and beneﬁts of SNN classiﬁcators.","doi":"10.3390\/bdcc7020110","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2504-2289\/7\/2\/110","issn":"2504-2289","volume":"7"}}

Hence, it is important to predict and maintain the performance of the gear system, since any unpredictable failure in this system can seriously threaten human lives and cause significant economic losses. Therefore, it is essential to inspect the gear teeth at regular intervals for identifying the crack propagation or other damages affecting the system in advance at the early stage. In this study, a new method have been proposed by the researchers which utilized artificial intelligence processes for routine maintenance. A new 3rd generation Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) has been used for diagnosing and classifying the faults occurring in the spur gear systems based on the Acoustic Emission (AE) signals. Hence, they developed a test rig with various seeded gear faults, which later processed the acquired AE signals by utilizing the preprocessing technique based on the Slantlet Transform (SLT), feature extraction and Information Gain (IG) processes. These processes were used before the use of a feature selection technique which was used for developing the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) diagnosis and classification model. These processes were run using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for fault diagnosis and classification of spur gears. Results of the study showed that this process could improve the accuracy of the diagnosis system depending on the features and information which was fed to the model. In this study, the researchers investigated the probability of increasing the accuracy better for the spur gear fault diagnosis with the help of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) process. They achieved an accuracy of ≥95% when using SNN. Finally, it was concluded that the proposed technique was as an effective tool for diagnosing and classifying the faults identified in the spur gears.","doi":"10.1109\/eSmarTA56775.2022.9935414","url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/9935414\/","isbn":"978-1-66546-181-8","location":"Ibb, Yemen"}}
