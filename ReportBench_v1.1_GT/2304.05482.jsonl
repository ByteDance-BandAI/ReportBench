Oncol.","abstract":"Prostate cancer can be diagnosed by prostate biopsy using\ntransectal ultrasound guidance. The high number of pathology\nimages from biopsy tissues is a burden on pathologists, and\nanalysis is subjective and susceptible to inter-rater\nvariability. The use of machine learning techniques could make\nprostate histopathology diagnostics more precise, consistent, and\nefficient overall. This paper presents a new classification\nfusion network model that was created by fusing eight advanced\nimage features: seven hand-crafted features and one deep-learning\nfeature. These features are the scale-invariant feature transform\n(SIFT), speeded up robust feature (SURF), oriented features from\naccelerated segment test (FAST) and rotated binary robust\nindependent elementary features (BRIEF) (ORB) of local features,\nshape and texture features of the cell nuclei, the histogram of\noriented gradients (HOG) feature of the cavities, a color\nfeature, and a convolution deep-learning feature. Matching,\nintegrated, and fusion networks are the three essential\ncomponents of the proposed deep-learning network. The integrated\nnetwork consists of both a backbone and an additional network.\nWhen classifying 1100 prostate pathology images using this fusion\nnetwork with different backbones (ResNet-18\/50, VGG-11\/16, and\nDenseNet-121\/201), we discovered that the proposed model with the\nResNet-18 backbone achieved the best performance in terms of the\naccuracy (95.54%), specificity (93.64%), and sensitivity\n(97.27%) as well as the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (98.34%). However, each of the assessment\ncriteria for these separate features had a value lower than 90%,\nwhich demonstrates that the suggested model combines differently\nderived characteristics in an effective manner. Moreover, a\nGrad-CAM++ heatmap was used to observe the differences between\nthe proposed model and ResNet-18 in terms of the regions of\ninterest. This map showed that the proposed model was better at\nfocusing on cancerous cells than ResNet-18. Hence, the proposed\nclassification fusion network, which combines hand-crafted\nfeatures and a deep-learning feature, is useful for\ncomputer-aided diagnoses based on pathology images of prostate\ncancer. Because of the similarities in the feature engineering\nand deep learning for different types of pathology images, the\nproposed method could be used for other pathology images, such as\nthose of breast, thyroid cancer."}}

Pathologists are now striving to digitize their data, workflows, and interpretations, assisted by the enabling development of whole-slide imaging. Going digital means that the analog process of human diagnosis can be augmented or even replaced by rapidly evolving AI approaches, which are just now entering into clinical practice. But with such progress comes challenges that reflect a variety of stressors, including the impact of unrepresentative training data with accompanying implicit bias, data privacy concerns, and fragility of algorithm performance. Beyond such core digital aspects, considerations arise related to difficulties presented by changing disease presentations, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options. While some tools such as data federation can help with broadening data diversity while preserving expertise and local control, they may not be the full answer to some of these issues. The impact of AI in pathology on the field's human practitioners is still very much unknown: installation of unconscious bias and deference to AI guidance need to be understood and addressed. If AI is widely adopted, it may remove many inefficiencies in daily practice and compensate for staff shortages. It may also cause practitioner deskilling, dethrilling, and burnout. We discuss the technological, clinical, legal, and sociological factors that will influence the adoption of AI in pathology, and its eventual impact for good or ill.","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0740257023000175","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1053\/j.semdp.2023.02.006","issn":"0740-2570","note":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) , machine learning ML) and digital pathology integration are the next major chapter in our diagnostic pathology and laboratory medicine arena","year":"2023","pages":"100-108","number":"2","volume":"40","journal":"Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology"}}

Therefore, in this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of bias and fairness in facial expression recognition by comparing three different approaches, namely a baseline, an attribute-aware and a disentangled approach, on two well-known datasets, RAF-DB and CelebA. Our results indicate that: (i) data augmentation improves the accuracy of the baseline model, but this alone is unable to mitigate the bias effect; (ii) both the attribute-aware and the disentangled approaches equipped with data augmentation perform better than the baseline approach in terms of accuracy and fairness; (iii) the disentangled approach is the best for mitigating demographic bias; and (iv) the bias mitigation strategies are more suitable in the existence of uneven attribute distribution or imbalanced number of subgroup data.","pages":"506--523","address":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","year":"2020","booktitle":"Computer Vision -- ECCV 2020 Workshops","editor":"Bartoli, Adrien\nand Fusiello, Andrea"}}

Nonetheless, it may result in significant discrimination if not handled properly. Indeed, CV systems highly depend on training datasets and can learn and amplify biases that such datasets may carry. Thus, the problem of understanding and discovering bias in visual datasets is of utmost importance; yet, it has not been studied in a systematic way to date. Hence, this work aims to: (i) describe the different kinds of bias that may manifest in visual datasets; (ii) review the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets; (iii) discuss existing attempts to collect visual datasets in a bias-aware manner. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets is still open, and there is room for improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be addressed. Moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets and make them explicit.

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems.
