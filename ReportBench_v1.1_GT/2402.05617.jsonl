While some approaches have been developed that are specific to the job market domain, there is a lack of generalized, multilingual models and benchmarks for these tasks. In this study, we introduce a language model called ESCOXLM-R, based on XLM-R-large, which uses domain-adaptive pre-training on the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy, covering 27 languages. The pre-training objectives for ESCOXLM-R include dynamic masked language modeling and a novel additional objective for inducing multilingual taxonomical ESCO relations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of ESCOXLM-R on 6 sequence labeling and 3 classification tasks in 4 languages and find that it achieves state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 9 datasets. Our analysis reveals that ESCOXLM-R performs better on short spans and outperforms XLM-R-large on entity-level and surface-level span-F1, likely due to ESCO containing short skill and occupation titles, and encoding information on the entity-level."}}

We propose the fraction of wage variation explained by the extracted skills as a novel performance metric for the comparison of methods. Using this, we compare the performance of the word-counting method with three different dictionaries and that of three unsupervised topic-modeling techniques, the LDA, the PLSA and the BERTopic. We apply these methods to a U.K. job board dataset of 1,158,926 job advertisements from 35 industries collected in 2018. We find that each of the dictionary-based methods explain about 20% of the wage variation across jobs. The topic modeling techniques perform better as the PLSA is able to explain 36.5% of the wage variation, while BERTopic 32.6%. The best performing method is the LDA with 48.3% of the wage variation explained. Its disadvantage, however, is in the difficulty of interpretation of the skills extracted."}}

Mitigating skills shortages in this dynamic world requires an adequate response from key stakeholders. However, recommendations derived from the traditional data sources, which lack granularity or are available with a significant time lag, may not address the emerging issues rightly. At the same time, society's increasing reliance on the use of the Internet for day-to-day needs, including the way individuals search for a job and match with employers, generates a considerable amount of timely and high granularity data. Analysing such nontraditional data as content of online job advertisements may help understand emerging issues across sectors and regions and allow policy makers to act accordingly. In this chapter, we are drawing on experience setting the Cedefop project based on big data and presenting examples of other numerous research projects to confirm the potential of using nontraditional sources of information in addressing a variety of research questions related to the topic of changing skills in a changing world."}}

We further examine skill requirements across and within four major professional occupations in the U.S. energy sector and find substantial variations. Meanwhile, in the energy sector, although cognitive and social skills are the most frequently required skills, they do not positively contribute to firm productivity. Although the requirement for “hard” skills (such as products and marketing, engineering, and general computer skill) stays relatively flat, “hard” skills actually matter most in the energy sector, especially products and marketing and general computer skills are two most valuable skills, contributing the highest to energy firms. Our results indicate that energy firms should pay more attention to “hard” skills in human resource management, while not following the increasing trend of “soft” skills in hiring."}}

The identification process is divided into Data Acquisition, Language Detection, Section Classification and Skill Recognition. Online job exchanges served as the data source. For identification of the part of a job advertisement containing the requirements, different machine-learning approaches were compared. Skills were extracted based on a POS-template. For classification of the found skills into predefined skill classes, different similarity measures were compared. The identification of the part of a job advertisement containing the requirements works with the pre-trained LinearSVC model for 100% of the tested job advertisements. Extracting skills is difficult because skills can be written in different ways in the German language especially since the language allows ad-hoc creation of compound. For extraction of skills, POS templates were used. This approach worked for 87.33% of the skills. The combination of a fasttext model and Levenshtein distance achieved a correct assignment of skills to skill classes for 75.33% of the recognized skills. The results show that extracting required skills from German-language job ads is complex."}}

Along this line, a large number of emerging models have been proposed, achieving remarkable performance in various tasks, such as person-job fit, job classification and salary prediction. However, existing studies are usually domain\/task specific, which significantly hinders the adaptation of models for different industries\/tasks with limited training data. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel skill-aware prompt-based pretraining framework, namely RecruitPro, which is capable of learning unified representations on the recruitment data and adapting for various downstream tasks of intelligent recruitment services. To be specific, we first present a contextualized embedding model that is pretrained on a large-scale recruitment dataset. Then, we construct 13 downstream benchmark tasks that are representative in the recruitment process. Along this line, we propose a skill-aware prompt learning module to enhance the adaptability of the pretrained model on downstream tasks. This module includes a skill-related prompt, which is designed to explore key semantic information (i.e., skills) from recruitment text, and a task-related prompt, which is designed to bridge the gap between the pretrained model and different downstream tasks. Moreover, we propose a strategy for extracting potential skills to further improve the performance of our skill-aware prompt learning module. Finally, extensive experiments have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of RecruitPro. In addition, a case study has been presented to discuss the privacy preserving issue of our RecruitPro."}}

This is the aim of Labour Market Intelligence (LMI), a field that is becoming increasingly relevant to EU Labour Market policies design and evaluation. The analysis of Web job vacancies, indeed, represents a competitive advantage to labour market stakeholders with respect to classical survey-based analyses, as it allows for reducing the time-to-market of the analysis by moving towards a fact-based decision making model. In this paper, we present our approach for automatically classifying million Web job vacancies on a standard taxonomy of occupations. We show how this problem has been expressed in terms of text classification via machine learning. We also show how our approach has been applied to certain real-life projects and we discuss the benefits provided to end users."}}

We construct a taxonomy for skills and map it into the recently developed ESCO classification system. We subsequently develop measures of the relevance of soft and hard skills and we analyze their detailed composition. We apply the dataset constructed to the debate on computerization of work. We show that soft and digital skills are related to the probability of automation of a given occupation and we shed some light on the complementarity\/substitutability of hard and soft skills."}}
