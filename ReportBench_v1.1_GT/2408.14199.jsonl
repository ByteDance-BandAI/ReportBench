However, self-driving labs also have limited accessibility, requiring either travel or replication. To overcome these limitations, the Cyber-Physical Mobility (CPM) Lab at RWTH Aachen University offers publicly available remote access (CPM Remote). CPM Remote is a web framework that provides an easy introduction to CAVs and, together with the connection to the physical lab, a direct reference to reality. However, simply providing a platform is usually not enough to engage users. Therefore, we presented an application example called CPM Olympics, which was developed for researchers. In this paper, we present a second application example called CPM Academy. It is tailored for practice-oriented education and therefore designed and developed for students. The CPM Academy follows a didactic approach with various gamification elements and features a level-like structure built around a realistic scenario in the form of a package delivery service. In this way, the CPM Academy enables the study of various current topics in the context of CAVs, including control engineering, motion planning, and decision making. In addition, automated feedback and benchmarking help to engage students and improve the algorithms developed. The CPM Academy is freely accessible and is already being used in a teaching course at RWTH Aachen University.","doi":"10.1109\/CDC49753.2023.10384102","shorttitle":"CPM Academy"}}

Novel robots for swarm applications are currently being developed as a result of recent advances in sensing, actuation, processing, power, and manufacturing. These platforms can be used by researchers to conduct experiments with robot collectives and by educators to include robotic hardware in their curricula. However, existing low-cost robots are specialized and can lack desired sensing, navigation, control, and manipulation capabilities. This letter presents a new mobile robot platform, Pheeno, that is affordable, versatile, and suitable for multirobot research, education, and outreach activities. Users can modify Pheeno for their applications by designing custom modules that attach to its core module. We describe the design of the Pheeno core and a three degree-of-freedom gripper module, which enables unprecedented manipulation capabilities for a robot of Pheeno's size and cost. We experimentally demonstrate Pheeno's ability to fuse measurements from its onboard odometry for global position estimation and use its camera for object identification in real time. We also show that groups of two and three Pheenos can act on commands from a central controller and consistently transport a payload in a desired direction.","doi":"10.1109\/LRA.2016.2524987","issn":"2377-3766","volume":"1"}}

Combining Mixed Reality with Digital Twin, mixedDT integrates the virtual and physical spaces into a mixed one, where physical entities coexist and interact with virtual entities via their digital counterparts. Under the framework of mixedDT, MCCT contains three major experimental platforms in the physical, virtual and mixed spaces respectively, and provides a unified access for various human-machine interfaces and external devices such as driving simulators. A cloud unit, where the mixed experimental platform is deployed, is responsible for fusing multi-platform information and assigning control instructions, contributing to synchronous operation and real-time cross-platform interaction. Particularly, MCCT allows for multi-vehicle coordination composed of different multi-source vehicles (e.g., physical vehicles, virtual vehicles and human-driven vehicles). Validations on vehicle platooning demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of MCCT.","doi":"10.1109\/TIV.2023.3243096","issn":"2379-8904","volume":"8"}}

In the last decade, many open-source hardware and software frameworks for wheeled robots have been presented, mainly in the form of unicycles and car-like robots, with the goal of making robotics accessible to a wider audience and to support control systems development. Unicycles are usually small and inexpensive, and therefore facilitate experiments in a larger fleet, but they are not suited for high-speed motion. Car-like robots are more agile, but they are usually larger and more expensive, thus requiring more resources in terms of space and money. In order to bridge this gap, we present Chronos, a new car-like 1\/28th scale robot with customized open-source electronics, and CRS, an open-source software framework for control and robotics. The CRS software framework includes the implementation of various state-of-the-art algorithms for control, estimation, and multi-agent coordination. With this work, we aim to provide easier access to hardware and reduce the engineering time needed to start new educational and research projects.","doi":"10.1109\/ICRA48891.2023.10161434","shorttitle":"Chronos and CRS"}}
