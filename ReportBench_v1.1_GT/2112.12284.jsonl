{"bib_id":"EN_Vidal","title":"New adaptive filters as perceptual preprocessing for rate-quality performance optimization of video coding","author":"Eloïse Vidal and Nicolas Sturmel and Christine Guillemot and Patrick Corlay and Francois-Xavier Coudoux","meta_info":{"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce two perceptual filters as pre-processing techniques to reduce the bitrate of compressed high-definition (HD) video sequences at constant visual quality. The goal of these perceptual filters is to remove spurious noise and insignificant details from the original video prior to encoding. The proposed perceptual filters rely on two novel adaptive filters (called BilAWA and TBil) which combine the good properties of the bilateral and Adaptive Weighting Average (AWA) filters. The bilateral and AWA filters being initially dedicated to denoising, the behaviour of the proposed BilAWA and TBil adaptive filters is first analyzed in the context of noise removal on HD test images. The first set of experimental results demonstrates their effectiveness in terms of noise removal while preserving image sharpness. A just noticeable distortion (JND) model is then introduced in the novel BilAWA and TBil filters to adaptively control the strength of the filtering process, taking into account the human visual sensitivity to signal distortion. Visual details which cannot be perceived are smoothed, hence saving bitrate without compromising perceived quality. A thorough experimental analysis of the perceptual JND-guided filters is conducted when using these filters as a pre-processing step prior to MPEG-4\/AVC encoding. Psychovisual evaluation tests show that the proposed BilAWA pre-processing filter leads to an average bitrate saving of about 19.3% (up to 28.7%) for the same perceived visual quality. The proposed new pre-filtering approach has been also tested with the new state-of-the-art HEVC standard and has given similar efficiency in terms of bitrate savings for constant visual quality.","keywords":"Video coding, Pre-processing, Image filtering, Adaptive weighting average (AWA) filter, Bilateral filter, Just noticeable distortion (JND), Image quality","year":"2017","pages":"124-137","volume":"52","journal":"Signal Processing: Image Communication"}}
