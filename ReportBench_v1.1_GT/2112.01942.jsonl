Physical-consistency of the GMM is ensured by imposing a prior on the component assignments biased by a novel similarity metric that leverages locality and directionality. The resulting GMM is then used to learn globally asymptotically stable Dynamical Systems (DS) via a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) re-formulation. The proposed DS learning scheme accurately encodes challenging nonlinear motions automatically. Finally, a data-efficient incremental learning framework is introduced that encodes a DS from batches of trajectories, while preserving global stability. Our contributions are validated on 2D datasets and a variety of tasks that involve single-target complex motions with a KUKA LWR 4+ robot arm.

Thus, we investigate how a robotic arm can be used to assemble a structure from predefined discrete building blocks autonomously. Since assembling structures is a challenging task that involves complex contact dynamics, we propose to use a combination of reinforcement learning and planning for this task. In this work, we take a first step towards autonomous construction by training a controller to place a single building block in simulation. Our evaluations show that trial-and-error algorithms that have minimal prior knowledge about the problem to be solved, so called model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms, can be successfully employed. We conclude that the achieved results, albeit imperfect, serve as a proof of concept and indicate the directions for further research to enable more complex assemblies involving multiple building elements.","keywords":"Discrete design, Robots in architecture, Reinforcement learning","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S092658052100457X","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.autcon.2021.104006","issn":"0926-5805","year":"2022","volume":"133","journal":"Automation in Construction"}}

This information may be obtained by force and position sensors on the assembly device, and used to make small corrections in the paths of parts while they are in contact and coming together. Two issues are involved: what path corrections to make, and how to make them in a stable dynamic fashion, given that such motions will alter the subsequent information. This paper presents a formal representation of vector force feedback strategies and shows that they must be expressed as control problems. Stability bounds are derived based on simple linear actuator models and sampled data control. These bounds are verified using computer simulation and laboratory test apparatus.","month":"06","year":"1977","pages":"91-97","number":"2","volume":"99","journal":"Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control"}}
