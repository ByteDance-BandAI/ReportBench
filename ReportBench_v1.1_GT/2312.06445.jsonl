ProQuest Dissertations Publishing","abstract":"Coiled polymer actuators (CPA) are a recently discovered smart\nmaterial. Due to their large tensile stoke and power densities\nthey are often used as actuators or artificial muscles. CPA's\nare fabricated from a polymer fiber, typically nylon,\nmechanically twisted into a coil or coiled around a mandrel and\nannealed. When heated over the glass transition temperature they\ncan contract, expand or exhibit torsional actuation, depending\non the fabrication method and end conditions. The fabrication\nand application of CPA is well documented and has made many\ninnovations in the fields of smart materials, soft robotics and\nthe likes. However, there is a lack of knowledge in the modeling\nof CPA, this is partly due to the novelty of the actuator. To\naddress this problem, a theoretical and experimental\ninvestigation of thermo-mechanical response is proposed. An\nenergy and variational methods and continuum mechanics approach\nis utilized with numerical methods to describe the actuation\nresponse. To verify the model, the numerical simulation\ndisplacement response is compared to CPA samples that are\nfabricated and experimentally tested in lab using a dynamic\nmachine analyzer (DMA). The results indicate the proposed model\naccurately predict the actuation response of the CPA under\nthermal loading. The numerical simulation and experimental\ncomparison is in good agreement and helps to further understand\nthe underlining cause of the actuation behavior of the coiled\npolymer actuator. Furthermore, the model can be used in\napplication purposes where the results of the model can be used\nin designing and optimizing soft robotics using CPA as an\nartificial muscle. In addition to the numerical and experimental\ninvestigation of the CPA's thermomechanical response, an\napplication in biomimetics is being studied. Biomimetics is an\ninterdisciplinary field in engineering and sciences used to\novercoming complex human challenges by designing and fabricating\nmaterials and systems modeled after nature. Applications of\nbiomimicry can be seen in many technological advancements such\nas catheters, hearing devices, and artificial appendages such as\narms, legs and fingers. The inspiration for this study is the\nhydrofoil like structured pectoral fin of the Harbor Porpoise\nwhale. Studies will be focused on understanding the fluid forces\nacting on the pectoral fin. First and foremost, a highly\naccurate pectoral fin is fabricated from CT scans of a Harbor\nPorpoise whale fin. 3D models are obtained using Simpleware\nScanIP and post-processed in Autodesk for 3D printing\ncomponents, which were used to assemble to artificial whale fin.\nAn array of thermally driven Coiled Polymer Actuators (CPA)\nfabricated from Nylon and heated with Nichrome are used as\nartificial muscles for actuating the pectoral fin. CPA's were\nused for their similarity to biological muscles and are of great\ninterest due to its high specific power and large actuation\nstroke. A simple control circuit for supplying power to the\nNichrome heating wires is developed using an Arduino and motor\ndrivers. The displacement over time of the fin is tested and\ncaptured using a laser distant sensor. The fin shows a great\ndisplacement response, largely deflecting in both direction\nrelative to its size. The artificial fin was then be further\nutilized in our studies. The fluid forces imposed on the fin\nwhile in motion was measured in a laboratorycontrolled setting.\nA low-velocity belt driven tow tank was used to displace the\nartificial fin through water. The tow velocity was varied, and\nthe drag force measurements were taken with and without fin\nactuation using a cantilever beam load cell. A theoretical\nderived drag force was compared to the experimental drag data\nand showed good comparison for the non-actuated fin. Increased\ndrag was exhibited with actuation in both directions when towed\nthrough water. This demonstrates the ability of the fin to\nmanipulate is geometry to change the drag force on itself\nserving as a controllable hydrofoil.

Artificial muscles may accelerate the development of robotics, haptics, and prosthetics. Although advances in polymer-based actuators have delivered unprecedented strengths, producing these devices at scale with tunable dimensions remains a challenge. We applied a high-throughput iterative fiber-drawing technique to create strain-programmable artificial muscles with dimensions spanning three orders of magnitude. These fiber-based actuators are thermally and optically controllable, can lift more than 650 times their own weight, and withstand strains of &gt;1000%. Integration of conductive nanowire meshes within these fiber-based muscles offers piezoresistive strain feedback and demonstrates long-term resilience across &gt;105 deformation cycles. The scalable dimensions of these fiber-based actuators and their strength and responsiveness may extend their impact from engineering fields to biomedical applications.","eprint":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1126\/science.aaw2502","url":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1126\/science.aaw2502","doi":"10.1126\/science.aaw2502","year":"2019","pages":"145-150","number":"6449","volume":"365","journal":"Science"}}

Now, Haines et al. (p. 868; see the Perspective by Yuan and Poulin) show that this is possible. Twisting high-strength, readily available polymer fibers, such as those used for fishing lines or sewing thread, to the point where they coil up, allowed construction of highly efficient actuators that could be triggered by a number of stimuli. Polymer fibers can be transformed into highly efficient artificial muscles through the application of extreme twist. [Also see Perspective by Yuan and Poulin] The high cost of powerful, large-stroke, high-stress artificial muscles has combined with performance limitations such as low cycle life, hysteresis, and low efficiency to restrict applications. We demonstrated that inexpensive high-strength polymer fibers used for fishing line and sewing thread can be easily transformed by twist insertion to provide fast, scalable, nonhysteretic, long-life tensile and torsional muscles. Extreme twisting produces coiled muscles that can contract by 49%, lift loads over 100 times heavier than can human muscle of the same length and weight, and generate 5.3 kilowatts of mechanical work per kilogram of muscle weight, similar to that produced by a jet engine. Woven textiles that change porosity in response to temperature and actuating window shutters that could help conserve energy were also demonstrated. Large-stroke tensile actuation was theoretically and experimentally shown to result from torsional actuation.","eprint":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1126\/science.1246906","url":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1126\/science.1246906","doi":"10.1126\/science.1246906","year":"2014","pages":"868-872","number":"6173","volume":"343","journal":"Science"}}

With these advantages and capabilities in mind, roboticists have begun to use textiles, not simply as substrates, but as functional components that program actuation and sensing. In parallel, materials scientists are developing new materials that respond to thermal, electrical, and hygroscopic stimuli by leveraging textile structures for function. Although textiles are one of humankind's oldest technologies, materials scientists and roboticists are just beginning to tap into their potential. This review provides a textile-centric survey of the current state of the art in wearable robotic garments and highlights metrics that will guide materials development.

Smith  and Shane K. Mitchell  and Christoph Keplinger ","meta_info":{"abstract":"A class of fast, muscle-mimetic actuators uses electrohydraulic coupling to linearly contract on activation. Soft robotic systems are well suited to unstructured, dynamic tasks and environments, owing to their ability to adapt and conform without damaging themselves or their surroundings. These abilities are crucial in areas such as human-robot interaction. Soft robotic systems are currently limited by the soft actuators that power them. To date, most soft actuators are based on pneumatics or shape-memory alloys, which have issues with efficiency, response speed, and portability. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are controlled and powered electrically and excel with muscle-like actuation, but they typically require a rigid frame and prestretch to perform effectively. In addition, DEAs require complex stacks or structures to achieve linear contraction modes. We present a class of soft electrohydraulic transducers, termed Peano-HASEL (hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic) actuators, that combine the strengths of fluidic actuators and electrostatic actuators, while addressing many of their issues. These actuators use both electrostatic and hydraulic principles to linearly contract on application of voltage in a muscle-like fashion, without rigid frames, prestretch, or stacked configurations. We fabricated these actuators using a facile heat-sealing method with inexpensive commercially available materials. These prototypical devices demonstrated controllable linear contraction up to 10%, a strain rate of 900% per second, actuation at 50 hertz, and the ability to lift more than 200 times their weight. In addition, these actuators featured characteristics such as high optical transparency and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. Hence, this class of actuators demonstrates promise for applications such as active prostheses, medical and industrial automation, and autonomous robotic devices.","eprint":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1126\/scirobotics.aar3276","url":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1126\/scirobotics.aar3276","doi":"10.1126\/scirobotics.aar3276","year":"2018","pages":"eaar3276","number":"14","volume":"3","journal":"Science Robotics"}}

In this work, LCEs are combined with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal-to-electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium–indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heats and cools to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage-controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed-loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking toward a heat source and harvesting energy is introduced.

This paper proposes to develop soft pneumatic actuators out of multiple Diels&ndash;Alder polymers that can generate strong covalent bonds at the multi-material interface by means of a heat&ndash;cool cycle. Through tensile testing it is proven that high interfacial strength can be obtained between two merged Diels&ndash;Alder polymers. This merging principle is exploited in the manufacturing of multi-material bending soft pneumatic actuators in which interfaces are no longer the weakest links. The applicability of the actuators is illustrated by their operation in a soft hand and a soft gripper demonstrator.

It is experimentally illustrated that full recovery of severe damage can be obtained by subjecting the multi-material actuators to a healing cycle.","issn":"2076-0825","url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0825\/9\/2\/34","article-number":"34","number":"2","year":"2020","volume":"9","journal":"Actuators"}}

The authors aim to answer this question by contrasting, synthesizing, and simultaneously testing three scientometric perspectives—universalism, social constructivism, and presentation—on the influence of article and author characteristics on article citations. They study all articles published in a sample of five major journals in marketing from 1990 to 2002 that are central to the discipline. They count the number of citations each of these articles has received and regress this count on an extensive set of characteristics of the article (i.e., article quality, article domain, title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity) and the author (i.e., author visibility and author personal promotion). They find that the number of citations an article in the marketing discipline receives depends more on “what is said” (quality and domain) and “who says it” (author visibility and personal promotion) than on “how it is said” (title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity). The insights gleaned from this analysis contribute to the marketing literature and are relevant to scientific stakeholders, such as the management of scientific journals and individual academic scholars, as they strive to maximize citations. They are also relevant to marketing practitioners; they inform practitioners on characteristics of the academic journals in marketing and their relevance to decisions they face. Conversely, the insights also raise challenges regarding how to make journals accessible and relevant to marketing practitioners: (1) Authors visible to academics are not necessarily visible to practitioners; (2) the readability of an article may hurt academic credibility and impact, but it may be instrumental in influencing practitioners; and (3) it remains questionable whether articles that academics assess to be of high quality are also managerially relevant.

The resultant glycerol-hydrogel exhibited high stretchability (strain at break up to 2700%), outstanding tensile strength and toughness (up to 2.8 MPa and 19.3 MJ m−3, respectively), long-term dehydration resistance to high temperature (60 °C), and excellent anti-freezing properties at low temperature (−45 °C). Furthermore, excellent self-healing capability was demonstrated by the healing of the hydrogel after three months of storage at temperatures as low as −45 °C.

One promising method to control their movement is by utilizing liquid vaporization. In most cases, liquid with high vapor pressure is injected into hollow cavities inside the elastomer. Heating the system vaporizes the liquid, and the structure is inflated by the generated gas. However, there is a significant time lag between powering the system and structural actuation due to the slow increase in temperature that is exacerbated by heat loss. Simply using materials with low thermal conductivity can improve actuation, but the reduced heat loss concurrently increases cooling time during the reversing process. Furthermore, underwater actuation through vaporization remains a challenge, since heat loss becomes even more significant. To address these issues, this study aims to develop a system that can actively control heat loss to enhance both actuation and cooling while performing consistently even in extreme environments. First, double-walled structures were fabricated with silicone elastomer to drastically lower thermal conductivity. Next, a thermoelectric device was installed on the bottom layer to heat and cool the sealed liquid by reversing current flow. The low thermal conductivity of the double-walled structure enhanced actuation performance, while actively cooling the system with the thermoelectric device accelerated the reversing process. Structures with single- and double-layered walls were tested underwater to validate their performance. Finite element models verified the effects of wall designs on heat transfer and structural mechanics.

The extent of movement is determined mostly by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the materials arranged in a bi-\/tri-layer structure. However, current CNT-based ETAs usually accomplish only simple actions with limited movements. In this work, we successfully developed novel ETAs that are capable of carrying out various controllable movements, such as extremely high bending curvature or unique actuations mimicking a wheel and a worm. These superior functionalities are achieved by adding a third layer or hinges composed of a thermo-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP) onto a bi-layer CNT-kapton ETA. To predict the unique movements of the “triangle” and “worm” actuators, finite element simulations were performed.

To solve this problem, the authors have been researching soft actuators driven by gas-liquid phase changes (GLPCs).In this study, a fixed chamber containing a constantan heater and fluorocarbon was used to generate pressure instead of a compressor.

This paper presents new data on porcine muscle tissue and a detailed analysis of all previous work. The conclusion is that, in most cases, fracture toughness has not in fact been measured for these tissues. Reanalysis of the previous work shows that failure of the test specimens generally occurred at the material’s ultimate strength, implying that no information about toughness can be obtained from the results. This finding applied to work on cartilage, artificial neocartilage, muscle and the TMJ disc. Our own data, which was also found to be invalid, gave measured fracture toughness values which were highly variable and showed a strong dependence on the crack growth increment. The net-section failure stress and failure energy were relatively constant in large specimens, independent of crack length, whilst for smaller specimens they showed a strong size effect. These findings are explained by the fact that the process zone size, estimated here using the critical distance parameter L, was similar to, or larger than, critical specimen dimensions (crack length and specimen width). Whilst this analysis casts doubt on much of the published literature, a useful finding is that soft tissues are highly tolerant of defects, able to withstand the presence of cracks several millimetres in length without significant loss of strength.","keywords":"Fracture toughness, Strength, Soft tissue, Cartilage, Muscle","url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S175161611100289X","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmbbm.2011.09.018","issn":"1751-6161","year":"2012","pages":"139-147","volume":"6","journal":"Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials"}}

There has been some dispute about material response of muscle in different fiber directions. It is necessary to have a better understanding of fiber orientation based material properties of skeletal muscle, to ensure the accuracy of computational models of muscle. To this end, the aim of this study was to investigate fiber orientation–based material properties in vitro and simulate them with finite element analysis (FEA).MethodsTensile testing was performed on 5 samples of skeletal muscle from a goat at a strain rate of 0.15 s−1 with fiber orientation along the length (P) and 45° incline to the fiber direction (I). FEA was completed using the experimental condition to validate the results of the in vitro test. The cross-fiber direction was simulated using FEA.ResultsThe stresses for all fiber directions at maximum stretch were 1,973.2 kPa for fiber direction P, 1,172 kPa for direction I and 430 kPa for the cross-fiber direction. The tensile strengths of the skeletal muscle were 0.44 MPa for P and 0.234 MPa for I. The elastic modulus of muscle tissue in all fiber directions was 1.59 MPa for fiber direction P (Ep), 0.621 MPa for 45° direction I (EI) and 0.43 MPa for the cross-fiber direction (Ec).

The need to support the two most basic functions [three-dimensional (3D)–shaped support and actuation] independently for a typical robot demands that at least two components should be used in its construction. Therefore, component assembly is unavoidable despite the ultimate dream of creating assembly-free robots. We devise a strategy that uses a programmable crystalline shape memory polymer with thermo- and photo-reversible bonds to create a single-component robot. The global 3D-shaped structural support is fabricated via a plasticity-based origami technique enabled by the thermo-reversible bonds. More critically, precisely controlled localized actuation can be programmed into the 3D origami via spatially defined reversible shape memory using the photo-reversible bonds. The overall result is that a polymer thin film can be programmed into various soft robots including a 3D crane and an elephant.

However, the shape deformation and coalescence of EGaIn particles under mechanical stress often lead to parasitic electrical conduction, imposing limitations on its utilization in thermal management. Increasing the loading of EGaIn nanoparticles (>20 vol%) often leads to brittleness of the composite. Herein, a strategy to obtain thermally conductive and soft elastomers with a high-volume ratio of EGaIn nanoparticles (44 vol%) is introduced. Surface modification of EGaIn nanoparticles with carboxylic acid terminated polydimethylsiloxane (COOH-PDMS-COOH) coupled with the in situ formation of a PDMS matrix by crosslinking with the surface-modified EGaIn nanoparticles leads to dense EGaIn nanoparticles in a PDMS matrix with effective thermal transport. Notably, despite the high-volume ratio of EGaIn nanoparticles in the elastomer, the composite maintains a low elastic modulus (6.91 kPa) and remains electrically insulating even under mechanical stress. In addition, a distinctive anisotropic thermal conductivity of the elastomer is established upon stretching. This elastomer can be utilized as a thermal interface layer for thermoelectric devices.

Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW\/kg—all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle.

Here, LM-based functional composites that do not freeze and remain soft and stretchable at extremely low temperatures are introduced. It is shown that the confinement of LM droplets to micro-\/nanometer length scales significantly suppresses their freezing temperature (down to −84.1 from −5.9 °C) and melting point (down to −25.6 from +17.8 °C) independent of the choice of matrix material and processing conditions.

This paper presents a framework to facilitate comparisons between broad-scale plot-based classification approaches. Results Our framework is based on the distinction of four structural elements (plot record, vegetation type, consistent classification section and classification system) and two procedural elements (classification protocol and classification approach). For each element we describe essential properties that can be used for comparisons. We also review alternative choices regarding critical decisions of classification approaches; with a special focus on the procedures used to define vegetation types from plot records.

This simplicity, however, often brings a strict limitation: unimodal deformation upon inflation. Here, multistability is embraced to design modular, inflatable structures that can switch between distinct deformation modes as a response to a single input signal. This system comprises bistable origami modules in which pressure is used to trigger a snap-through transition between a state of deformation characterized by simple deployment to a state characterized by bending deformation. By assembling different modules and tuning their geometry to cause snapping at different pressure thresholds, structures capable of complex deformations that can be pre-programmed and activated using only one pressure source are created. This approach puts forward multistability as a paradigm to eliminate a one-to-one relation between input signal and deformation mode in inflatable systems.","eprint":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1002\/adfm.202201891","url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/adfm.202201891","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/adfm.202201891","keywords":"inflatables, multistability, origami","pages":"2201891","number":"35","volume":"32","journal":"Advanced Functional Materials"}}

The soft actuator is composed of two layers of disulfide liquid crystal elastomer (ss-LCE) film with embedded resistive heating wires of serpentine shape.
