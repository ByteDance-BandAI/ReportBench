Despite their significant progresses in genetic research, understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive. Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering, and biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL, mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal discovery with continuous variables. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery. Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence of causation, while lack of association between two variables. Telling cause from effect between two continuous variables from observational data is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in omics and imaging data analysis. Our preliminary simulations and real data analysis will show that the ANMs will be one of choice for bivariate causal discovery in genomic and imaging data analysis.","issn":"1664-8021","doi":"10.3389\/fgene.2018.00347","url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fgene.2018.00347","year":"2018","volume":"9","journal":"Frontiers in Genetics"}}

This paper leverages a recently proposed normalizing-flow-based method to perform counterfactual inference upon a structural causal model (SCM), in order to achieve harmonization of such data. A causal model is used to model observed effects (brain magnetic resonance imaging data) that result from known confounders (site, gender and age) and exogenous noise variables. Our formulation exploits the bijection induced by flow for the purpose of harmonization. We infer the posterior of exogenous variables, intervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM to obtain counterfactuals. This approach is evaluated extensively on multiple, large, real-world medical datasets and displayed better cross-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

We take advantage of radiology reports accompanying the chest X-ray images to define concepts. We discover sparse associations between concepts and hidden units using a linear sparse logistic regression. To ensure that the identified units truly influence the classifier's outcome, we adopt tools from Causal Inference literature and, more specifically, mediation analysis through counterfactual interventions.

However, to infer cause-effect relationships rather than simple associations from observational data, we need to (i) express the causal relationships leading to cognitive decline in a graphical model, and (ii) ensure the causal effect of interest is identifiable from the collected data. We derive a causal graph from the current clinical knowledge on cause and effect in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, and show that identifiability of the causal effect requires all confounders to be known and measured. However, in complex neuroimaging studies, we neither know all potential confounders nor do we have data on them. To alleviate this requirement, we leverage the dependencies among multiple causes by deriving a substitute confounder via a probabilistic latent factor model. In our theoretical analysis, we prove that using the substitute confounder enables identifiability of the causal effect of neuroanatomy on cognition. We quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on semi-synthetic data, where we know the true causal effects, and illustrate its use on real data on the Alzheimer's disease continuum, where it reveals important causes that otherwise would have been missed.","pages":"45--57","address":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","year":"2021","booktitle":"Information Processing in Medical Imaging","editor":"Feragen, Aasa\nand Sommer, Stefan\nand Schnabel, Julia\nand Nielsen, Mads"}}

DCM is typically analyzed with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. However, because the inversion of a large-scale continuous system is difficult when noisy observations are present, DCM by EM is typically limited to a small number of compartments (<10). Another drawback with the current method is its complexity; when the forward model changes, the posterior mean changes, and we need to re-derive the algorithm for optimization. In this project, we propose the Multiple-Shooting Adjoint (MSA) method to address these limitations. MSA uses the multiple-shooting method for parameter estimation in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under noisy observations, and is suitable for large-scale systems such as whole-brain analysis in functional MRI (fMRI). Furthermore, MSA uses the adjoint method for accurate gradient estimation in the ODE; since the adjoint method is generic, MSA is a generic method for both linear and non-linear systems, and does not require re-derivation of the algorithm as in EM. We validate MSA in extensive experiments: 1) in toy examples with both linear and non-linear models, we show that MSA achieves better accuracy in parameter value estimation than EM; furthermore, MSA can be successfully applied to large systems with up to 100 compartments; and 2) using real fMRI data, we apply MSA to the estimation of the whole-brain effective connectome and show improved classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) vs. control compared to using the functional connectome.

One option is to go to another medical center for a trained classifier. Sadly, tissue classifiers do not generalize well across centers due to voxel intensity shifts caused by center-specific acquisition protocols. However, certain aspects of segmentations, such as spatial smoothness, remain relatively consistent and can be learned separately. Here we present a smoothness prior that is fit to segmentations produced at another medical center. This informative prior is presented to an unsupervised Bayesian model. The model clusters the voxel intensities, such that it produces segmentations that are similarly smooth to those of the other medical center. In addition, the unsupervised Bayesian model is extended to a semi-supervised variant, which needs no visual interpretation of clusters into tissues.","pages":"360--371","address":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","year":"2019","booktitle":"Information Processing in Medical Imaging","editor":"Chung, Albert C.
